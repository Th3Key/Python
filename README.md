# _Python_

_Python is a programming language created in the early 1990s by **Guido van Rossum**._

_From the beginning, the idea behind the  language was to make programming simpler, more intuitive, and closer to natural thought._
_The simplicity is one of the main reasons Python is loved by beginners, but behind its friendly surface lies incredible power, which is why professionals use it for:_

- _**Large-Scale Applications**_
- _**Data Science**_
- _**Artificial Intelligence**_
- _**Robotics**_

_Python operates as an **interpreted language**, eliminating the need for compilation before execution._

_Furthermore it is **dinamically typed**, meaning that variable types do not require explicit declaration._

_Another distinctive feature is **indentation**. Unlike many other languages that rely on curly braces **{}** to define code blocks, Python enforces indentation through spaces or tabs._
