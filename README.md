# _Python_

_Python is a programming language created in the early 1990s by **Guido van Rossum**._

_From the beginning, the idea behind the language was to make programming simpler, more intuitive, and closer to natural thought._
_The simplicity is one of the main reasons Python is loved by beginners, but behind its friendly surface lies incredible power, which is why professionals use it for:_

- :globe_with_meridians: _**Large-Scale Applications**_
- :electron: _**Data Science**_
- :brain: _**Artificial Intelligence**_
- :robot: _**Robotics**_

_The guiding principles of Python's design are encapsulated in the **Zen of Python**, a short manifesto that emphasizes simplicity, explicitness, and elegance. These principles are not abstract ideals but practical guidelines that shape the language itself._

## _Overview_

_Python is a **high-level**, **interpreted language**, designed to prioritize readability and clarity. Its source code is automatically compiled into **bytecode** (an intermediate, low-level representation of the program), which is then executed by the interpreter, enabling rapid testing and development._

_The syntax of Python distinguishes it from many other languages. **Indentation** is used to define the structure of code, replacing the braces or keywords that are common elsewhere. The result is source code that is clean, uniform, and immediately comprehensible._\
_Another defining aspect of Python is its **dynamic typing system**. Variables do not need to be declared with explicit types; the type is inferred automatically at runtime. At the same time, Python maintains strong rules for type behavior, ensuring that values behave predictably even in the absence of explicit declarations._\
_It is also **case-sensitive**, meaning that identifiers with different letter cases are treated as distinct names (**keywords** are fixed in lowercase)._

_The language does not confine developers to a single paradigm. **Procedural programming**, **Object-Oriented design**, and **Functional constructs** can coexist within the same project. This versatility allows Python to adapt to a wide variety of domains, from small scripts that automate routine tasks to large systems that require complex architectures._

_A significant advantage of Python lies in its comprehensive **standard library**. Modules for mathematics, file manipulation, networking, and system interaction are included with every installation. Beyond this foundation, the **Python Package index** provides access to thousands of external libraries, extending the language into specialized fields._

_Python is also **platform-independent**, working consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux environments. This portability simplifies deployment and collaboration, ensuring that code developed in one context can easily be executed in another. The **open-source** nature of the language has cultivated an exceptionally large and active community, which contributes documentation, tutorials, and improvements to the ecosystem._

## _Variables and Data Types_

_A variable in Python is a symbolic name that stores data in memory. Variables act as containers for values, allowing programs to work with data in a flexible way. In Python, variables are created the moment a value is assigned to them (there is no need to declare their type explicitly)._

_```name = "Chris"```_\
_```age = 25```_

_<sub>**name** stores a string<sub>_\
_<sub>**age** stores an integer<sub>_

_In Python, every value and variable belongs to a **data type**, which determines how the data is stored, how it can be manipulated, and what operations can be performed on it. Python orgranizes data types into two broad categories: **built-in types** and **user-defined types**._
